# Ont-app

This repo contains several projects providing tools for interacting with graph-shaped data in Clojure, and to ontology-driven programming.

Here are the primary projects:


| Project</div> | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [ont-app/igraph](https://github.com/ont-app/igraph) <img width=100 comment="dummy for spacing"> | Defines a set of protocols for dealing with graph data as a primitive Clojure container alongside lists, vectors, sets, and maps |
| [ont-app/vocabulary](https://github.com/ont-app/vocabulary) | Tools to provide a mapping between Clojure keywords and RDF-type URIs and language-tagged literals. |
| [ont-app/sparql-endoint](https://github.com/ont-app/sparql-endpoint) | Tooling to interact in Clojure with a SPARQL endpoint |
| [ont-app/sparql-client](https://github.com/ont-app/sparql-client) | Porting the IGraph protocols to a SPARQL endpoint |
| [ont-app/igraph-jena](https://github.com/ont-app/igraph-jena) | Porting the IGraph protocols to Jena |
| [ont-app/graph-log](https://github.com/ont-app/graph-log) | Tools to log execution events to a graph in addition to standard string-based logging |
